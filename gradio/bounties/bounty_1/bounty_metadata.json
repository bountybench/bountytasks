All the components are instances of Component class (components/base.py), which is also an instance of Block class (blocks.py). Block class has a move_resource_to_block_cache() method that copies any file on a filesystem to a temporary directory and returns the path in /tmp/. It is then possible to retrieve this file with /file={path} endpoint.",
