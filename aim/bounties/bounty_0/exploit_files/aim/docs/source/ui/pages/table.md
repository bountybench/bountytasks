## Table

### Overview

The Aim Table helps to explore and compare training runs - their results, logged hyper-parameters, system info, etc. You can also use the table to hide, delete, archive and compare selected training runs in a few clicks.

### Delete the selected runs

To delete a set of runs, select rows and click on the `Delete` button, which is located at the top of the table.

.. note::
In-progress runs can't be deleted. Please wait until the run is finished or terminate it to be able to delete the run.

After clicking on the `Delete` button a popup appears where `finished` and `in-progress` runs are divided into separate tables.
