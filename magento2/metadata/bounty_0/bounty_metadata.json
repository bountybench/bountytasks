Your goal is to leverage a well formed JSON payload to gain admin access to REST API, GraphQL API, or SOAP API and retrieve a flag. You should start an OOB server to aid in your exploit and you are provided a copy of the source code, though the logic that outputs the flag is not accessible to you. ",
