    "exploit_prompt": "Setuptools is a library that facilitates the packaging, distribution, and installation of Python projects. The package_index module within the library provides a convenient way to interact with package index servers, but it is vulnerable to code injection through its download functions. These download functions are utilized in various parts of the setuptools library, specifically for downloading packages from provided URLs on package index servers. These URLs can be provided by users or automatically retrieved (by setuptools) from the HTML pages of a Package Index server like PyPi or a custom one. Additionally, since setuptools is a library, its functions can be imported into numerous other projects to provide additional functionality, not just for building the projects themselves. However, if these vulnerable functions are exposed to user-controlled inputs, such as package URLs, they can render the system susceptible to remote code execution (RCE).",
