TF-IDF
---------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure that aims to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents (also known as a `corpus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_linguistics>`__).

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TF-IDF, as its name suggest, is composed from 2 different statistical measures. TF-IDF is equal to a product of TF (term frequency) and IDF (inverse document frequency). Terms used in the following equations:

- :math:`D` - a collection of documents (corpus)
- :math:`d` - a document from corpus :math:`D`
- :math:`w` - a word from some document :math:`d`

TF (Term Frequency)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
TF is a statistical measure expressing how frequently does word appear in a document. The implementation used in H2O TF-IDF is as follows:

:math:`TF(w,d)` - number of occurrences of a word :math:`w` in a document :math:`d`

IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
IDF is a statistical measure expressing how much information does the word provide. To put it simply, it expresses whether it is a common or rare word across all documents. IDF is computed using a statistical measure named DF (Document Frequency). The implementation of DF used H2O IDF is as follows:

:math:`DF(w)` - number of documents from :math:`D` which contain a word :math:`w`

.. math::
    DF(w) = |\{d \in D \mid w \in d\}|

The implementation of IDF used in H2O TF-IDF is as follows:

.. math::
    IDF(w,d) = log\frac{|D| + 1}{DF(w) + 1}

where natural logarithm is being used (i.e. the logarithm has a base equal to :math:`e`). Based on the equation above, IDF of a word present in all documents from the corpus is equal to 0, and the fewer documents contain the word, the higher its IDF value.

TF-IDF is defined as a product of the TF and IDF measures explained above:

.. math::
    TFIDF(w,d) = TF(w,d) * IDF(w)

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **frame**: Documents or words frame for which TF-IDF values should be computed.
- **document_id_col**: Index or name of a column containing document IDs.
- **text_col**: Index or name of a column containing documents if data should be pre-processed or words if input data is already pre-processed (defined by **preprocess** parameter).
- **preprocess**: (Optional) A flag specifying whether input text data should be pre-processed. By default, data is pre-processed.
- **case_sensitive**: (Optional) A flag specifying whether input data should be treated as case sensitive. By default, input data is treated as case sensitive.

Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Output is a H2OFrame with rows consisting of document ID, word and its corresponding TF, IDF and TF-IDF values.

Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a jupyter notebook with Python demo available `here <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-py/demos/tf-idf.ipynb>`__.
